This paper proposes an automation of waste material segregation in scrap industry. This method is easy 
and simple solution of segregation of three types of wastes glass, metal and plastic. It is designed to sort 
the trash into metallic waste, plastic waste and glass waste ready to be processed separately for the next 
process of operation. The method uses inductive sensors metallic items, and capacitive sensors to 
distinguish between and dry waste. Experimental results show that the segregation of waste into metallic, 
plastic and glass waste has been successfully implemented using the automation of material segregation 
(AMS) method.
